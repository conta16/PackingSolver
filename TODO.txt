in z3, apply reducing and symmetry breaking constraints. (done, to be checked)

Investigate a possible solution of the problem if it was possible to rotate the circuits, e.g. a nxm circuit could be placed as a mxn one

Write a report: #not me please
	- Describe how you tackle points 1-7 in pdf
	- add code for CSP, add FOL or PL formulas for SAT and SMT
	- Show experimental results

Create README for all the basic instructions on how to run the code

Prepare submission folder. It must contain: #not me please
	- the pdf report
	- a directory out with the output files corresponding to input files
	- a directory src with all the source code with the README
A .zip or .tgz file must be uploaded, named with the surnames of the group members
