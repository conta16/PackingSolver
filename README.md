# Packing solver

In this repository you can find some solutions to the **packing problem**. The first model is in standard **CSP** written in *Minizinc*. We also defined **SAT** and **SMT** models, providing *Minizinc* and *Python Z3* solutions each. <br>
In order to write the models, we took inspiration from [A SAT-based Method for Solving the Two-dimensional Strip Packing Problem](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-451/paper16soh.pdf) by Takehide Soh, Katsumi Inoue, Naoyuki Tamura, Mutsunori Banbara and Hidetomo Nabeshima
